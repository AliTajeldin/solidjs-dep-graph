* change base Node::handleDblClick to _blahblah to avoid name conflict
* link / copy READMe into lib dir so it can become part of release
* delayed loading test case!

* add helper PathShape that only requires a "path" method and implements the render,shapeinfo methods directly.
   Use DbShape as the example for a simple path shape.
* add height/width override to node. (not to be computed based on string length)
* add resize handler window.onResize and get innnerHeight/Width of enclosing window!
   OR, use @solid-primitives/resize-observer for a solidjs specific answer.
* add option for "ranker" layout options (e.g. "network-simplex", "tight-tree", "longest-path")
* scale graph to fit view port if graph is too big or always or none.  Or just add a fit() method
* should do pan by button down/up so only handle move when button is down.
* make pan/zoom an option (on by default)
* Node add a get width() getter that calls computeWidth() that would lazy eval
   the computed width based on input params
* Node add hover tool tip with extra info.
* add support for HTML nodes
* add support for multi-directional ("to" [default], "from", "both" for arrow type)
* add example/demo with node/edge factory (e.g. BlueNode(t,f) which creates a blue node)
* Add title to graph??? (this could even be a signal from caller.  Reading the prop will just work!!!)
* publish the library
* add maxWidth, maxHeight, and fitToSize attributes to Graph Component
* turn on minify in lib/demo build before publish!
* Examples to add:
   * callbacks example
   * multi-graph (to show independent state)
* add support for additional layout algorithms (e.g. ELK, force, etc)
