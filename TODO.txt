* add styling image example to top README (similar to custom shapes section) and remove TBD.
* remove TBD from readme and add blurp about example directory instead.
* add resize handler window.onResize and get innnerHeight/Width of enclosing window!
   OR, use @solid-primitives/resize-observer for a solidjs specific answer.
* add option for "ranker" layout options (e.g. "network-simplex", "tight-tree", "longest-path")
* scale graph to fit view port if graph is too big or always or none.  Or just add a fit() method
* should do pan by button down/up so only handle move when button is down.
* make pan/zoom an option (on by default)
* Node add hover tool tip with extra info.
* add support for HTML nodes
* add support for multi-directional ("to" [default], "from", "both" for arrow type)
* Add title to graph??? (this could even be a signal from caller.  Reading the prop will just work!!!)
* add maxWidth, maxHeight, and fitToSize attributes to Graph Component. How best to do this!
* turn on minify in lib/demo build before publish!
* Examples to add:
   * multi-graph (to show independent state)
* add support for additional layout algorithms (e.g. ELK, force, etc)
* make arrow and actual arrow and make current arrow triangle.
