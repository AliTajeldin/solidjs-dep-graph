* create separate example/lib directory and config vite to build a library
* add resize handler window.onResize and get innnerHeight/Width of enclosing window!
   OR, use @solid-primitives/resize-observer for a solidjs specific answer.
* scale graph to fit view port if graph is too big or always or none.  Or just add a fit() method
* should do pan by button down/up so only handle move when button is down.
* Node add a get width() getter that calls computeWidth() that would lazy eval
   the computed width based on input params
* Node add hover tool tip with extra info.
* add support for HTML nodes
* add support for multi-directional ("to" [default], "from", "both" for arrow type)
* move Graph to GraphInfo/Data and create a separate Graph component that does the rendering and takes GraphInfo as input.
   The component should also do the top level svg render that is in basic.tsx now.
   OOOOR, combine all these into a single <Graph nodes=[] edges=[]> component.  YAAAAAH, thats it.
* Add title to graph??? (this could even be a signal from caller.  Reading the prop will just work!!!)
