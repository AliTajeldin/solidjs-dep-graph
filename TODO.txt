* add resize handler window.onResize and get innnerHeight/Width of enclosing window!
   OR, use @solid-primitives/resize-observer for a solidjs specific answer.
* scale graph to fit view port if graph is too big or always or none.  Or just add a fit() method
* should do pan by button down/up so only handle move when button is down.
* make pan/zoom an option (on by default)
* Node add a get width() getter that calls computeWidth() that would lazy eval
   the computed width based on input params
* Node add hover tool tip with extra info.
* add support for HTML nodes
* add support for multi-directional ("to" [default], "from", "both" for arrow type)
* add example/demo with node/edge factory (e.g. BlueNode(t,f) which creates a blue node)
* Add title to graph??? (this could even be a signal from caller.  Reading the prop will just work!!!)
* publish the library
* add maxWidth, maxHeight, and fitToSize attributes to Graph Component
* turn on minify in lib/demo build before publish!
* Examples:
   * basic
   * Styles (node/edge color, dash, etc)
   * custom shapes
   * multi-graph (to show independent state)
